## 1. Two Pointers
Imagine you and your friend start at two ends of a line of toys. You both walk toward the middle, picking up or checking toys as you go. This helps you find or clean up toys faster!

## 2. Sliding Window
Think of a small window sliding over a long picture. You look only at the toys inside the window at a time. Move the window to see different parts without checking the whole picture every time.

## 3. Fast & Slow Pointers
Imagine you and your friend are running in a circle but you run fast and your friend runs slow. If you catch your friend again, you know you’re running around the same circle twice. This helps find loops!

## 4. Binary Search
You have a big book sorted by page numbers. To find a page, you open the book in the middle, then decide if your page is before or after. Keep cutting the book in half until you find the page — way faster than reading every page!

## 5. Divide and Conquer
If you want to clean your messy room, first split it into small parts — your desk, your bed, your shelves. Clean each part one by one, then the whole room is clean!

## 6. Depth-First Search (DFS) / Backtracking
Imagine you’re exploring a maze. You pick a path and go as far as you can. If it’s a dead end, you go back and try a different path until you find the exit!

## 7. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Think of throwing a ball to friends standing near you, then those friends throw it to friends further away. You check all friends close by first, then friends a little farther, and so on — layer by layer.

## 8. Dynamic Programming (DP)
You’re building a big LEGO castle. Instead of building every part from scratch, you save little parts you made before and reuse them again. This saves time!

## 9. Greedy Algorithms
Imagine picking candies one by one, always choosing the biggest candy first because it looks the best right now. Sometimes this helps you get the most candy quickly!

## 10. Heap / Priority Queue
Think of a magic box where the candy with the highest number or best taste always pops out first. This helps you get the best candy fast.

## 11. Graph Algorithms
Imagine a map of cities connected by roads. You want to find the best way to travel or check which cities are connected.

## 12. Union Find (Disjoint Set)
If you have many groups of friends, this trick helps you quickly find out if two friends belong to the same group or not.

## 13. Hashing
Imagine you have a super-organized toy box with labels on each toy’s spot so you can find a toy super fast without searching.

## 14. Math / Bit Manipulation
This is like magic math tricks with numbers, sometimes using secret codes made of 1s and 0s to solve puzzles quickly.
