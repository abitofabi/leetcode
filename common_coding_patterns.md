# Common Coding Interview Patterns

LeetCode 150 or Blind 75 questions can be broadly categorized by problem-solving **patterns** or **techniques**:

---

## 1. Two Pointers
- Use two indices/pointers moving through the array/string.
- Common for removing duplicates, merging sorted arrays, palindrome checking, etc.
- **Examples:** Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array, Container With Most Water.

## 2. Sliding Window
- Maintain a variable-size window (contiguous subarray).
- Great for substring or subarray problems.
- **Examples:** Minimum Window Substring, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.

## 3. Fast & Slow Pointers (Floyd’s Cycle Detection)
- Two pointers moving at different speeds.
- Useful for cycle detection in linked lists or arrays.
- **Examples:** Linked List Cycle, Find the Duplicate Number.

## 4. Binary Search
- Search in a sorted array or answer space by dividing problem.
- **Examples:** Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.

## 5. Divide and Conquer
- Break problem into smaller subproblems, solve, and combine.
- **Examples:** Merge Sort, Maximum Subarray
## 6. Depth-First Search (DFS) / Backtracking
- Explore all paths/possibilities recursively.
- **Examples:** Subsets, Combination Sum, Word Search.

## 7. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Level order traversal or shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Examples:** Binary Tree Level Order Traversal, Word Ladder.

## 8. Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Break problem into subproblems and store results.
- **Examples:** Climbing Stairs, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Coin Change.

## 9. Greedy Algorithms
- Make locally optimal choices.
- **Examples:** Jump Game, Gas Station.

## 10. Heap / Priority Queue
- Efficiently access min/max elements.
- **Examples:** Merge K Sorted Lists, Find Median from Data Stream.

## 11. Graph Algorithms
- Representations, traversal, shortest paths.
- **Examples:** Number of Islands, Course Schedule.

## 12. Union Find (Disjoint Set)
- Track connected components or detect cycles.
- **Examples:** Redundant Connection, Number of Connected Components.

## 13. Hashing
- Use hash sets/maps for quick lookup.
- **Examples:** Two Sum, Valid Anagram.

## 14. Math / Bit Manipulation
- Number theory or bit tricks.
- **Examples:** Single Number, Power of Two.

## How to use these categories?

- Identify the pattern fitting the problem.
- Example: Sorted arrays + pairs/removal → **Two Pointers**.
- Substrings/subarrays → **Sliding Window**.
- Recursion + combinations → **DFS/Backtracking**.
